# Training Mode - Tyro Edition

Training Mode - Tyro Edition is an expanded and updated version of UnclePunch's training modpack, further expanding on Aitch's Community Edition for Super Smash Bros. Melee in ways that I have felt would be useful from my past experiences using the program.

## Development
Please read [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

The Tyro version and stable game/save identity live in [version.h](version.h). Update `TM_VERSION` for a new release; keep `TM_GAME_ID` stable. Run `./build.sh --version` to see the version, game ID, and output filename.

## Tyro branch changelog

This section summarizes implemented Tyro-specific changes, newest version first. Keep one concise bullet per major feature within each version, updating that bullet for related adjustments. Changes to an earlier feature may receive a new bullet in a later version. Proposed changes stay in the relevant [OSD investigation](OSD-GLOBAL-SETTINGS-INVESTIGATION.md) or [Training Lab menu investigation](TRAINING-LAB-MENU-INVESTIGATION.md) until implemented.

### T4 (V1.4.1T4)

- Keep Low Laser Puff Practice's position lock in the native physics pass and refresh model matrices only on placement, avoiding late transform invalidation during active play.
- Add **Low Laser Puff Practice** to Character-specific Tech: Fox/Falco versus a fixed startup-crouch Puff, five positions, neutral laser/fastfall OSDs, saved OSD toggles and Reset %. See [event details](docs/LOW-LASER-PUFF.md).
- Rename Ledgedash's GALINT criterion to **Any GALINT** and add **4 GALINT**, **7 GALINT**, and **10 GALINT**, requiring at least that many frames on first becoming actionable.
- Repair Training Lab's Stadium form selector for Hazards On/Off, including Normal, correct Rock/Water mapping, queued changes and held forms. See [transformation details](docs/STADIUM-TRANSFORMATIONS.md). tl;dr, fixed the pokemon stadium stage transformation logic in Training Lab
- Add event-local Hitbox Trails profiles to Ledgedash and Under Fire, overriding global trails; Under Fire starts with trails Off.
- Add Ledgechase Training as General Tech #17, with selectable fighters on Final Destination, saved ledge/punish presets and spacing, native ledge options, fastfall jumps and automatic retries.
- Add event-local CPU Invincibility Overlay colors to Ledgechase and Techchase, overriding the global CPU tint; make both Techchase chance-menu titles read Tech Chances.
- Add nine saved Techchase chance presets, ground/platform starting locations and Spotdodge Punish; remember its OSD, reset, invisibility and camera-mode choices while keeping manual percentages and camera coordinates session-only.
- Add global A-Smash Release timing feedback, with 1f as the fastest A-button release; group its menu row above both OSD overrides and preserve existing palette storage.
- Verify and protect unused event-score storage for a separate 16-byte preferences extension, preserving all original scores, assigning Ledgechase a fixed spare score slot and leaving 72 spare bytes.
- Replace Ledgedash's Protection Highlight with event-local Highlight Dropped Invincibility, using the red diagnostic pulse when protection drops. It overrides the global invincibility tint. Is enabled by default in Under Fire.
- Make Under Fire restart after hits or deaths, resetting its lava and timer for repeated practice; show Session Best beneath the timer and save an improved high score on pause-menu Exit.
- Reset Side-B Sweetspot after landing on stage or platforms following Side-B, unfreezing Marth and preserving the existing death and ledge reset timing.

### T3 (V1.4.1T3)

- Remember the selected event and page across sessions, restoring the cursor and scroll position on boot.
- Add numbered Fox/Falco Side-B Sweetspot distance guides that include drift, with a saved Enable Line Guides toggle defaulting to On.
- Extend the Invincibility Overlay to Marth and Roy's active grounded and aerial counter windows.
- Rework the Training Lab menu with eight category tabs, clearer option rows, descriptions and submenu previews, and apply/cancel value pickers; retain parent selections, shortcuts and existing saves.

### T2 (V1.4.1T2)

- Add saved Fixed Grid and Practice Panel OSD layouts with reserved feature positions, retained results and manual paging; Fixed Grid shows ten OSDs per page, while Practice Panel includes three previous timing results.
- Add saved OSD title colors and previews in both editors, plus separate CPU and all-OSD overrides in reorganized Global Settings menus.
- Simplify timing OSDs with compact frame counts, smaller arrows, colored hitlag/turnaround context and best-frame-relative colors; extend Act OoWait to landing and direct recovery exits.
- Replace Fox/Falco Act OoShine predictions with confirmed Jump Out Of Shine results, turnaround context and failure detection; give Jump Out Of Shine and JC Shine separate layout slots and histories, with corrected hitlag handling.
- Clarify Wavedash feedback with explicit hop types and duration-based colors, and add explicit L-cancel Success/Missed feedback.
- Fix corrupted, duplicated and overlapping OSD text by correcting native color encoding, row replacement and text sizing, with regression coverage.
- Add global Very Fast and Instant hitbox trails with player/team colors, translucent history, subfighter/projectile support and reliable cleanup across resets, restores and scene changes.
- Add a player-colored Invincibility Overlay for ledge, respawn, dodges, moves and Yoshi's double-jump armor, with reliable protection detection and rendering across respawns.
- Add Actionable Yellow>Green recovery cues and red Missed L Cancel / Run Turnaround diagnostics, with corrected detection and cue priority.
- Add full-health Infinite Shields for main fighters and subfighters.
- Expand Ledgedash with Attack/Dash goals, ledge selection, Protection Highlight, four success criteria and criterion-aware statistics; add configurable ground/platform egg targets and preserve reset behavior and randomized targets through regrabs.
- Save Ledgedash and Eggs-ercise event settings and add Reset Event Settings to both events; also correct Ledgedash's frame-advance button lookup.
- Remember human and CPU character choices across unrestricted events and saved sessions, using local fallbacks for events with required fighters.
- Consolidate saved settings into the existing 44-byte record, preserving scores, OSD choices and colors while saving every Lab overlay condition and migrating earlier Tyro settings.
- Fix memory-card crashes during settings saves and save creation by deferring saves to the initialized card service, guarding native save handling and correcting game-ID relocation.
- Centralize version metadata and give Tyro a separate disc/save identity, save caption, versioned release filenames, cross-platform patchers and matching banner/symbol-map names.
- Make partial builds rebuild modules after version/identity changes and stop ISO updates when a C module fails to compile.

### T1 (v1.4.1 T1)

- Add Eggs-ercise hitbox trails and Very Fast / Instant decay options in Eggs-ercise and Training Lab.
- Add Tyro Edition names, version labels and banners, with corrected in-game banner colors.
- Remove the restriction on AI-assisted contributions from the development guidelines.
